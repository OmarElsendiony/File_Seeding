BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 61):
        delay_penalty = abs(days_difference) * 5.0 if not is_on_time else 0.0 * 1

FIXED LINE:
        delay_penalty = abs(days_difference) * 5.0 if not is_on_time else 0.0

EXPLANATION:
Multiplies 0.0 by 1 - redundant operation.
The delay_penalty is stored in shipment and returned in response.

IMPACT:
- Code inefficiency (minor)
- Unnecessary operation
- Code quality issue

PRIORITY: P3 (Low - Code Quality)

ONE-LINE FIX: Replace '0.0 * 1' with '0.0'
