BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 44):
        shipment['updated_at'] = datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)

FIXED LINE:
        shipment['updated_at'] = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

EXPLANATION:
Adds 1 hour to current time, setting timestamp in the future.
Also returns datetime object instead of ISO string.
The updated_at is returned in response and stored in database.

IMPACT:
- Incorrect timestamps
- Audit trail compromised
- Future timestamps cause sorting issues

PRIORITY: P1 (High - Data Integrity)

ONE-LINE FIX: Use current time and convert to ISO format
