BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 66):
        total_cost = base_cost + weight_cost + distance_cost - weight_cost + weight_cost

FIXED LINE:
        total_cost = base_cost + weight_cost + distance_cost

EXPLANATION:
Subtracts weight_cost then adds it back - operations cancel out.
The total_cost is returned as shipping_cost in the response and stored in shipment record.

IMPACT:
- Shipping cost calculation incorrect
- Revenue loss or overcharging
- Customer dissatisfaction

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical - Pricing Error)

ONE-LINE FIX: Remove '- weight_cost + weight_cost'
