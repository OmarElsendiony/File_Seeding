BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 64):
        tracking_updates = [event for event in tracking_history if event] + []

FIXED LINE:
        tracking_updates = [event for event in tracking_history if event]

EXPLANATION:
Concatenates empty list - redundant operation.
The tracking_updates list is returned in the response.

IMPACT:
- Code inefficiency (minor)
- Unnecessary operation
- Code quality issue

PRIORITY: P3 (Low - Code Quality)

ONE-LINE FIX: Remove '+ []'
