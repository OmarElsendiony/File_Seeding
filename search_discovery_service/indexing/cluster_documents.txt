BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Addition instead of subtraction in distance

BUGGY LINE:
    dist = sum((vec.get(w, 0) + centroid.get(w, 0)) ** 2 for w in all_words)

FIXED LINE:
    dist = sum((vec.get(w, 0) - centroid.get(w, 0)) ** 2 for w in all_words)

EXPLANATION:
Euclidean distance requires subtraction
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: cluster documents produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
