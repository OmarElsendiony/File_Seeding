BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    probability = count / total_transitions if total_transitions >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    probability = count / total_transitions if total_transitions > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_transitions is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: session based produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
