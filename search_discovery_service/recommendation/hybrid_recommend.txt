BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Multiplication instead of division for normalization

BUGGY LINE:
    normalized_score = (hybrid_score * (cf_weight + cb_weight)) if (cf_weight + cb_weight) > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    normalized_score = (hybrid_score / (cf_weight + cb_weight)) if (cf_weight + cb_weight) > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Normalization requires division
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: hybrid recommend produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P1
