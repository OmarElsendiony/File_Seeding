BUG: Line 13 - Swapped variables in multiplication
    return dot_product / (magnitude2 * magnitude1)
FIX:
    return dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)
EXPLANATION: Order doesn't matter for multiplication, but conventionally wrong
IMPACT: None mathematically, but confusing and inconsistent
PRIORITY: P3 (Low - no functional impact)
