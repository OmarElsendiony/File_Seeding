BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong operation order

BUGGY LINE:
    match_rate = (len(matches) * 100 / total_candidates) if total_candidates > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    match_rate = (len(matches) / total_candidates * 100) if total_candidates > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Multiplying by 100 before division changes result
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: wildcard search produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P1
