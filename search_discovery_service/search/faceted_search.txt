BUG: Line 24 - Off-by-one error in average calculation
    avg_score = total_score / (len(filtered) + 1) if filtered else 0
FIX:
    avg_score = total_score / len(filtered) if filtered else 0
EXPLANATION: Adding 1 to denominator incorrectly lowers the average
IMPACT: Average score always underestimated
PRIORITY: P1
