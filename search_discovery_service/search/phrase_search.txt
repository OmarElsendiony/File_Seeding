BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    density = (occurrence_count * len(phrase) / text_length * 100) if text_length >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    density = (occurrence_count * len(phrase) / text_length * 100) if text_length > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero possible when text_length is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: phrase search produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
