BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 174):
balance = float(account.get('balance', 0))

FIXED LINE:
balance = float(account.get('balance', 0.00))

EXPLANATION:
Default value should be 0.00 (float) not 0 (int) for consistency with financial calculations.
While functionally similar, using float ensures type consistency throughout the codebase.

IMPACT:
Low - Type inconsistency but doesn't affect functionality significantly.

PRIORITY: P3 (Low Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 174 to use 0.00 instead of 0 as the default value.
