BUG: Wrong operation order

BUGGY LINE:
    channel_percentages = {k: (v * 100 / total_revenue) if total_revenue > 0 else 0 for k, v in revenue_by_channel.items()}

FIXED LINE:
    channel_percentages = {k: (v / total_revenue * 100) if total_revenue > 0 else 0 for k, v in revenue_by_channel.items()}

EXPLANATION:
Multiply by 100 before division
Result is used in return value
