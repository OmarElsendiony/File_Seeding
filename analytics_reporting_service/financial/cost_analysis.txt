BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    fixed_percentage = (fixed_costs / total_costs * 100) if total_costs >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    fixed_percentage = (fixed_costs / total_costs * 100) if total_costs > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_costs is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: cost analysis produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
