BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    variance_percentage = (variance / budgeted * 100) if budgeted >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    variance_percentage = (variance / budgeted * 100) if budgeted > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when budgeted is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: budget variance produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
