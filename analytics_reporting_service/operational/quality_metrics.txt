BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    pass_rate = (passed / total_inspected * 100) if total_inspected >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    pass_rate = (passed / total_inspected * 100) if total_inspected > 0 else 0

Division by zero when total_inspected is 0
Result is used in return value
