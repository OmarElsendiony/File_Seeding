BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (< instead of <=)

BUGGY LINE:
    on_time = sum(1 for lt in lead_times if lt < target_lead_time)

FIXED LINE:
    on_time = sum(1 for lt in lead_times if lt <= target_lead_time)

EXPLANATION:
Excludes orders at exact target
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: lead time analysis produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P2
