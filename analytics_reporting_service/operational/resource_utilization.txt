BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    overall_utilization = (total_used / total_capacity * 100) if total_capacity >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    overall_utilization = (total_used / total_capacity * 100) if total_capacity > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_capacity is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: resource utilization produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
