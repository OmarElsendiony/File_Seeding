BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    gross_margin = (gross_profit / total_revenue * 100) if total_revenue >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    gross_margin = (gross_profit / total_revenue * 100) if total_revenue > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_revenue is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: product profitability produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
