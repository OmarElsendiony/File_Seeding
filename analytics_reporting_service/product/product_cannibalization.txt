BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Addition instead of multiplication

BUGGY LINE:
    correlation = covariance / (std_a + std_b) if (std_a + std_b) > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    correlation = covariance / (std_a * std_b) if (std_a * std_b) > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Correlation formula requires multiplication
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: product cannibalization produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
