BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    selection_rate = (total_selected / total_requested * 100) if total_requested >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    selection_rate = (total_selected / total_requested * 100) if total_requested > 0 else 0

Division by zero when total_requested is 0
Result is used in return value
