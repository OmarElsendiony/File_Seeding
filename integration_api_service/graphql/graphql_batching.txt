BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong division order

BUGGY LINE:
    batch_efficiency = (total_queries * 100 / 10) if total_queries > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    batch_efficiency = (10 / total_queries * 100) if total_queries > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Efficiency should decrease with more queries
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: graphql batching produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P2
