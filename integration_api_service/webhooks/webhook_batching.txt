BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    avg_batch_size = total_events / total_batches if total_batches >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    avg_batch_size = total_events / total_batches if total_batches > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_batches is 0
Result is used in return value
