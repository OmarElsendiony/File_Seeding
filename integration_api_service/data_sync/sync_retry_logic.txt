BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    retry_probability = ((max_attempts - attempt) / max_attempts * 100) if max_attempts >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    retry_probability = ((max_attempts - attempt) / max_attempts * 100) if max_attempts > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when max_attempts is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: sync retry logic produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
