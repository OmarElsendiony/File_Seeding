BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    amount_deviation = abs(amount - avg_transaction) / avg_transaction if avg_transaction >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    amount_deviation = abs(amount - avg_transaction) / avg_transaction if avg_transaction > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when avg_transaction is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: payment fraud detection produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
