BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    success_rate = (len(successful) / total_payments * 100) if total_payments >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    success_rate = (len(successful) / total_payments * 100) if total_payments > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_payments is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: payment analytics produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
