BUG: Wrong operation order

BUGGY LINE:
    split_percentage = (split_total * 100 / (split_total + remaining_total)) if (split_total + remaining_total) > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    split_percentage = (split_total / (split_total + remaining_total) * 100) if (split_total + remaining_total) > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Multiply by 100 before division
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: order splitting produces incorrect results
