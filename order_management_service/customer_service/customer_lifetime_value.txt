BUG DESCRIPTION

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    avg_order_value = total_spent / order_count if order_count >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    avg_order_value = total_spent / order_count if order_count > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when order_count is 0
Result is used in return value
