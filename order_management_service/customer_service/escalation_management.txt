BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    avg_response_time = sum(response_times) / response_count if response_count >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    avg_response_time = sum(response_times) / response_count if response_count > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when response_count is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: escalation management produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
