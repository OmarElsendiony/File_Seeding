BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Addition instead of subtraction

BUGGY LINE:
    nps = ((promoters + detractors) / total_responses * 100) if total_responses > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    nps = ((promoters - detractors) / total_responses * 100) if total_responses > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
NPS is promoters minus detractors
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: customer satisfaction score produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P1
