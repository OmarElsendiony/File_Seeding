BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Multiplication instead of division

BUGGY LINE:
    avg_time_between_events = transit_time * event_count if event_count > 1 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    avg_time_between_events = transit_time / (event_count - 1) if event_count > 1 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Average calculation wrong
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: shipping tracking produces incorrect results
