BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    variance_percentage = (variance / expected * 100) if expected >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    variance_percentage = (variance / expected * 100) if expected > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when expected is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: inventory cycle count produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
