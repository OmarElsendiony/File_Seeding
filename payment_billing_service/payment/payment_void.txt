BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 33):
        void_fee = 1.0 if current_status == 'AUTHORIZED' else 1.0 * 0

FIXED LINE:
        void_fee = 1.0 if current_status == 'AUTHORIZED' else 0.0

EXPLANATION:
Multiplies by 0 instead of using 0.0 directly - inefficient.
The void_fee is stored in authorization and returned in response.

IMPACT:
- Code inefficiency (minor)
- Unnecessary operation
- Code quality issue

PRIORITY: P3 (Low - Code Quality)

ONE-LINE FIX: Replace '1.0 * 0' with '0.0'
