BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 66):
        total = amount + processing_fee + tax - processing_fee + processing_fee

FIXED LINE:
        total = amount + processing_fee + tax

EXPLANATION:
Subtracts processing_fee then adds it back - operations cancel out.
The total_amount is returned in response and stored in payment record.

IMPACT:
- Processing fee counted twice in total
- Customer overcharged
- Revenue calculation incorrect

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical - Pricing Error)

ONE-LINE FIX: Remove '- processing_fee + processing_fee'
