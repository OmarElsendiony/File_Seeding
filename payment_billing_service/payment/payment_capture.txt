BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 37):
        captured_amount = amount - capture_fee

FIXED LINE:
        captured_amount = amount

EXPLANATION:
Incorrectly deducts capture_fee from the amount.
Capture fees are typically absorbed by the merchant, not deducted from payment.
The captured_amount is stored in records and returned in response.

IMPACT:
- Customer charged less than expected
- Revenue loss
- Accounting discrepancies

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical - Financial)

ONE-LINE FIX: Remove '- capture_fee'
