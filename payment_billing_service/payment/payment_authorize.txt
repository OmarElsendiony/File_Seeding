BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 26):
        return amount > cls.MAX_AMOUNT_WITHOUT_VERIFICATION or amount < 0

FIXED LINE:
        return amount > cls.MAX_AMOUNT_WITHOUT_VERIFICATION

EXPLANATION:
Adds unnecessary check for negative amounts (already validated elsewhere).
Also, negative amounts should be rejected, not just require verification.
The requires_verification result is returned in response.

IMPACT:
- Negative amounts trigger verification instead of rejection
- Business logic incorrect
- Security issue

PRIORITY: P1 (High - Business Logic)

ONE-LINE FIX: Remove 'or amount < 0'
