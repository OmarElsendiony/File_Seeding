BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    match_rate = (matches / total_required * 100) if total_required >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    match_rate = (matches / total_required * 100) if total_required > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_required is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: attribute based access produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
