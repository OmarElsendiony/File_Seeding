BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    grant_rate = (granted_count / total_requested * 100) if total_requested >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    grant_rate = (granted_count / total_requested * 100) if total_requested > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_requested is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: scope validation produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
