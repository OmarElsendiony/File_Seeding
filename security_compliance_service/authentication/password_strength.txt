BUG: Line 47-52 - Inverted logic in strength levels
    if score < 40:
        strength = 'weak'
    elif score >= 60:
        strength = 'medium'
    elif score >= 80:
        strength = 'strong'
    else:
        strength = 'very_strong'
FIX:
    if score < 40:
        strength = 'weak'
    elif score < 60:
        strength = 'medium'
    elif score < 80:
        strength = 'strong'
    else:
        strength = 'very_strong'
EXPLANATION: Should use < for upper bounds, not >=
IMPACT: Strength categories overlap incorrectly
PRIORITY: P1
