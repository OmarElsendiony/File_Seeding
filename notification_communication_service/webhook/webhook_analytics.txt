BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Wrong comparison (>= instead of >)

BUGGY LINE:
    success_rate = (successful / total_webhooks * 100) if total_webhooks >= 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    success_rate = (successful / total_webhooks * 100) if total_webhooks > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Division by zero when total_webhooks is 0
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: webhook analytics produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
