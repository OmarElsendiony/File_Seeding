BUG: Line 46 - Multiplication instead of division
    processing_rate = self.processed * remaining if remaining > 0 else self.processed
FIX:
    processing_rate = self.processed / (self.processed + remaining) if (self.processed + remaining) > 0 else 0
EXPLANATION: Processing rate should be ratio, not product
IMPACT: Processing rate calculation meaningless
PRIORITY: P2
