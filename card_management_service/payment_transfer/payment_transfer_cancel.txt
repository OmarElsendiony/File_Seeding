BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 158):
if status == "PENDING":

FIXED LINE:
if status == "pending":

EXPLANATION:
Status comparison uses uppercase but database stores lowercase status values.
This causes the cancellation check to fail for pending transfers.

IMPACT:
High - Cannot cancel pending transfers due to case mismatch.

PRIORITY: P1 (High Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 158 from 'if status == "PENDING":' to 'if status == "pending":'
