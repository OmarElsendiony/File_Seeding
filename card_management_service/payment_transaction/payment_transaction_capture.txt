BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 155):
if capture_amount < remaining_amount:

FIXED LINE:
if capture_amount > remaining_amount:

EXPLANATION:
Comparison operator is reversed. Should raise error when capture_amount is GREATER than
remaining_amount, but currently raises error when it's LESS than remaining amount.

IMPACT:
Critical - Allows capturing more than authorized amount.

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 155 from "if capture_amount < remaining_amount:" to "if capture_amount > remaining_amount:"
