BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 363):
authorization_data['capture'] = False

FIXED LINE:
authorization_data['captured'] = False

EXPLANATION:
Wrong field name used for tracking capture status. Should be 'captured' not 'capture'.
This causes issues when querying for uncaptured authorizations.

IMPACT:
Medium - Field name inconsistency affects capture tracking queries.

PRIORITY: P2 (Medium Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 363 from "authorization_data['capture'] = False" to "authorization_data['captured'] = False"
