BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 187):
if card_number is None:

FIXED LINE:
if card_number is not None:

EXPLANATION:
The validation logic is inverted. The code should return an error when card_number 
IS None (missing), but currently it returns an error when card_number is NOT None.

IMPACT:
Critical - Prevents ALL legitimate card additions from succeeding.

PRIORITY: P1 (High Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 187 from "if card_number is None:" to "if card_number is not None:"
