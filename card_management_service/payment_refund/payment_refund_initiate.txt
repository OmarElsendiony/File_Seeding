===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 175):
if refund_amount is None:

if refund_amount is not None:

but currently returns error when refund_amount is NOT None (present).

IMPACT:
Critical - Prevents ALL refund initiations from succeeding.

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 175 from "if refund_amount is None:" to "if refund_amount is not None:"
