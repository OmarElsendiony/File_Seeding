BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 123):
if resolution == 'merchant_favor':
    final_status = 'resolved_customer_favor'

FIXED LINE:
if resolution == 'customer_favor':
    final_status = 'resolved_customer_favor'

EXPLANATION:
Resolution logic is inverted. When resolution is 'merchant_favor', it sets status
to 'resolved_customer_favor' and vice versa. This is backwards.

IMPACT:
Critical - Dispute resolutions are assigned to the wrong party.

PRIORITY: P0 (Critical Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 123 to check for 'customer_favor' instead of 'merchant_favor'.
