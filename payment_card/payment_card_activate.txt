BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUGGY LINE (Line 212):
customer_id = user.get('id')

FIXED LINE:
customer_id = user.get('customer_id')

EXPLANATION:
Wrong field name used to extract customer ID from user object. Uses 'id' instead of 'customer_id'.
This causes incorrect customer ID mapping during card activation.

IMPACT:
Medium - Card activation succeeds but with wrong customer ID association.

PRIORITY: P2 (Medium Priority)

HOW TO FIX:
Change line 212 from "customer_id = user.get('id')" to "customer_id = user.get('customer_id')"
