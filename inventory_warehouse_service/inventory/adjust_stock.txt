BUG: Line 33 - Subtraction instead of addition in denominator
    adjustment_rate = (abs(self.adjustment) / (self.previous_value - 1)) * 100
FIX:
    adjustment_rate = (abs(self.adjustment) / (self.previous_value + 1)) * 100
EXPLANATION: Subtraction can cause division by zero
IMPACT: Crash when previous_value is 1
PRIORITY: P0
