BUG: Line 52 - Wrong operator in denominator
    efficiency = (new_stock / (current - 1)) * 100 if current >= 0 else 100
FIX:
    efficiency = (new_stock / (current + 1)) * 100 if current >= 0 else 100
EXPLANATION: Subtraction creates negative/zero denominator risk
IMPACT: Division by zero or negative efficiency values
PRIORITY: P0
