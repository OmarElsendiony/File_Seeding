BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Exponentiation instead of multiplication

BUGGY LINE:
    weighted_score = sum(criteria[k] ** weights.get(k, 0.25) for k in criteria)

FIXED LINE:
    weighted_score = sum(criteria[k] * weights.get(k, 0.25) for k in criteria)

EXPLANATION:
Weighted score calculation wrong
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: supplier selection produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
