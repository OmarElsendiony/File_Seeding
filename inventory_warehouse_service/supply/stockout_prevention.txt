BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Addition instead of subtraction

BUGGY LINE:
    z_actual = (current_stock + lead_time_demand) / lead_time_std if lead_time_std > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    z_actual = (current_stock - lead_time_demand) / lead_time_std if lead_time_std > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Z-score calculation wrong
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: stockout prevention produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
