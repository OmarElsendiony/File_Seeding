BUG DESCRIPTION
===============

BUG: Multiplication instead of division

BUGGY LINE:
    increments_needed = math.ceil(capacity_gap * capacity_increment) if capacity_increment > 0 else 0

FIXED LINE:
    increments_needed = math.ceil(capacity_gap / capacity_increment) if capacity_increment > 0 else 0

EXPLANATION:
Increment calculation wrong
Result is used in return value

IMPACT: capacity planning produces incorrect results
PRIORITY: P0
